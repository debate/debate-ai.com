/**
 * Intra-document live window ("self-transclusion") — the pure core.
 *
 * A `self_ref` node is a by-REFERENCE, read-only projection of another section
 * of the SAME document. It stores only `source_heading_id` (which section to
 * mirror) — no content copy. This module resolves that reference to the source
 * section's CURRENT content, recursively inlining any nested self-refs and
 * guarding against cycles. It is DOM-free and Electron-free (fully unit
 * testable); the NodeView + plugin build on it.
 *
 * The window is read-only: you edit at the source, never through the window.
 * That's what makes it conflict-free — one editable copy of any content, N live
 * views onto it — so none of the sync / divergence / freeze machinery the
 * by-value prototype needed exists here.
