/**
 * Live view CONTENT plugin — keeps each `self_ref`'s children equal to its
 * projected source, and enforces read-only.
 *
 * A live view now holds its mirrored section as REAL, id-less child content (so
 * native selection just works — no atom boundary). Those children are DERIVED,
 * not authored:
 *  - RE-DERIVE (appendTransaction + an initial pass on mount): whenever the
 *    source changes, replace a view's children with the projected source
 *    (`makeProjectionResolver`, ids blanked). Idempotent — a view whose children
 *    already match is skipped — `addToHistory:false`, and tagged so the read-only
 *    filter lets it through. The children are held OUT of collab sync (a
 *    loro-prosemirror patch makes `self_ref` sync childless), so every peer runs
 *    this LOCALLY against the shared source: the projection is never a CRDT value,
 *    so there is no concurrent-re-projection conflict to reconcile.
 *  - READ-ONLY (filterTransaction): reject a transaction whose edits ALL land
 *    INSIDE views (typing into one, a single find/replace match inside one)
 *    — except the re-derive. A transaction that ALSO edits outside a view
 *    (a bulk operation: condense, repair paragraph integrity, replace-all, a
 *    formatting sweep whose scope spans a view) is let through: the
 *    re-derive that follows restores every view from its source in the same
 *    dispatch, so the in-view steps can do no harm, while the rest of the
 *    document gets the operation. Rejecting those whole used to make every
 *    bulk operation a silent no-op in any document holding a view (design
 *    call 2026-09-09). The view is still selectable-across, deletable, and
 *    movable as a whole unit.
