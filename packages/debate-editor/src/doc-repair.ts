/**
 * Deterministic document repair for structural states ProseMirror never
 * produces locally but external content can: DOCX imports with irregular
 * tables, and merged documents from a sync layer. Pure function of the
 * doc — identical input yields identical repairs everywhere, and the
 * pass is idempotent (a repaired doc yields no further repair).
 *
 * Three passes, in order:
 *   1. prosemirror-tables `fixTables` — pads ragged rows and clamps
 *      colspan overflow so every row spans the same width.
 *   2. `excludes` sweep — text carrying both members of a mutually
 *      exclusive mark pair keeps the earlier-declared mark and drops the
 *      later one. ProseMirror enforces `excludes` in `Mark.addToSet`
 *      (local editing) but not on node construction, so externally built
 *      content can carry both.
 *   3. Container first-child invariant — a `card` must open with `tag`,
 *      an `analytic_unit` with `analytic` (their content expressions
 *      require it, but `NodeType.create` does not validate); an empty
 *      heading is inserted when missing. Heading `id` stamping is left
 *      to `stampMissingHeadingIds` at load: ids are random, and this
 *      pass must stay deterministic.
