/**
 * Session history files — the durable record behind Recover Previous
 * Version.
 *
 * Co-editing gives each participant undo over only their OWN changes,
 * so a session that gets wrecked (a bad merge, a hostile joiner) has no
 * recovery path once it ends: the session record is deleted on
 * Leave/End/tombstone by design (it exists for CRASH recovery — see
 * collab-persist), `.cmir` files carry no CRDT history, and the relay
 * compacts and tombstones its copy. This module writes a separate
 * `{roomId}.cmir-history` file into the crash-journals folder that
 * SURVIVES session end — deliberately including a remote tombstone,
 * since a deliberate attacker can end the session for everyone.
 *
 * The file is a full Loro snapshot (state + complete oplog) in a JSON
 * envelope. Because the CRDT never records wall-clock time
 * (`setRecordTimestamp` is off — turning it on would grow every change
 * and publish per-peer edit times to the room), the envelope carries
 * LOCAL observation times: each write notes how far every peer's op
 * counter had advanced by that moment. The version list derives its
 * timestamps from those observations, so nothing about the shared
 * document changes.
 *
 * Recovery never touches the live session: a chosen version is checked
 * out on a scratch LoroDoc built from the file and opened as a new
 * unsaved document. See collab-recover-ui.ts for the flow.
