/**
 * CollabSession — one collaboration session: a LoroDoc, the encrypted
 * room transport, and the sync discipline between them.
 *
 * Data flow:
 *   outbound  editor → LoroSyncPlugin → LoroDoc → (flush timer)
 *             export update-since-lastSent → encrypt → POST /updates
 *   inbound   SSE update frame (or catch-up GET) → decrypt →
 *             importBatch → Loro events → LoroSyncPlugin → editor
 *
 * Version bookkeeping invariant: everything covered by `lastSentVersion`
 * has either been queued for send or arrived from remote. `applyRemote`
 * therefore SYNCHRONOUSLY exports any un-flushed local diff before
 * importing (export is cheap and synchronous; only the POST is async) —
 * otherwise the next flush would re-export freshly imported remote ops
 * and echo them back to the room (harmless — updates are idempotent —
 * but wasteful at travel-day scale).
 *
 * Delivery discipline (mirrors card sharing): the stream is push-first;
 * every (re)connect hello triggers a catch-up fetch from our own cursor,
 * and a low-frequency catch-up timer heals stream frames the server shed
 * under backpressure. A shed frame is at worst a temporarily missing
 * causal dependency — Loro queues ops whose deps are absent and applies
 * them when the catch-up supplies the rest.
 *
 * The seed state travels as the room's FIRST regular update (a Loro
 * snapshot blob is just importable data), so joining is uniformly
 * "fetch everything after 0". The snapshot ENDPOINT is only compaction:
 * the host periodically uploads an encrypted snapshot so the server can
 * truncate the log and joins stay fast on long sessions.
