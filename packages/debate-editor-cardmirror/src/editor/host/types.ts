/**
 * Host interface — the platform abstraction the editor talks to for
 * everything that isn't pure DOM manipulation.
 *
 * Why this exists: CardMirror runs in three contexts (regular browser
 * tab, installed PWA, native desktop binary wrapped by Electron /
 * Tauri). Each context offers a different way to open files, save
 * files, store settings, etc. The editor proper doesn't care which
 * context it's in — it calls `host.openFile()` and `host.saveAs()`
 * and the right thing happens.
 *
 * Adding a new platform = writing a new Host implementation. Adding
 * a new capability = extending this interface and implementing it in
 * each platform host.
 *
 * Lifecycle: `getHost()` (from `./index.ts`) returns the singleton
 * for the current platform, picked once at module load and never
 * swapped. Host implementations may hold internal state (e.g. cached
 * file handles for in-place saves); they're not assumed to be pure.
