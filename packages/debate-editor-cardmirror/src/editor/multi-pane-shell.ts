/**
 * Multi-pane workspace shell.
 *
 * Mounted at boot when `settings.get('multiDocWorkspace')` is true.
 * Owns three slots (`slot1` / `slot2` / `slot3`), each holding a stack
 * of 0+ documents. Renders a per-slot pane with a small title chip,
 * the live ProseMirror EditorView, and a footer (word count + Open
 * file button). The nav pane is split into one section per active
 * slot. The shared ribbon, status bar, and Save / Save As route
 * through the focused pane via `setActiveView` in `editor/index.ts`.
 *
 * Comments: a single shared `#comments-column` sits to the right of
 * the multi-row like a narrow fourth slot. The threads shown follow
 * focus, and cards relayout against `view.coordsAtPos` on every
 * focused-pane scroll tick (the column doesn't share a scroll
 * container with any pane).
 *
 * Layout cells:
 *   - 1 active slot  → full width
 *   - 2 active slots → 50/50
 *   - 3 active slots → compact (thirds) OR wide-scroll (paged)
 *
 * Cross-pane drag = copy (handled in `drag-controller.ts`'s commit
 * branch for cross-view drops). Drag from doc → another doc's nav
 * section works the same way: the destination nav section's surface
 * declares its view, the controller treats it as cross-view.
