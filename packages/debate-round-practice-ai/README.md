## Project Setup Guide

### Backend Configuration
### Prerequisites
- Go (version 1.20 or later)
- MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)

---

### 1. Create the Backend Config File

The backend expects a `config.prod.yml` file at runtime.  
Only a sample config file is provided in the repository.

Create the required config file by copying the sample:

```bash
cd backend/config
cp config.prod.sample.yml config.prod.yml
```

---

### 2. Configure MongoDB

Update `backend/config/config.prod.yml` with a valid MongoDB connection string:

```yaml
database:
  uri: "<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>"
```

Without a valid MongoDB URI, the backend will fail to start.

---

### 3. (Optional) Gemini API Configuration

If the Gemini API key is not configured, the backend will still run, but AI-related features will be disabled.

```yaml
gemini:
  apiKey: "<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>"
```

---

### 4. Run the Backend Server

From the `backend` directory, start the server:

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

The server will start on the port defined in the config file (default: `1313`).

---

### Notes
- Do **not** commit `config.prod.yml` to version control.
- Only `config.prod.sample.yml` should remain committed.


### Frontend Configuration

1. In the `frontend/` directory, create a file named `.env`.

2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

```
VITE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1313"
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>"
```

- Replace `<YOUR_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID>` with your actual Google OAuth Client ID from Google Cloud Console.

> **Note:** Do **not** commit this file to a public repository. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to keep it secure.

---

### Running the Frontend (React + Vite)

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file and add:

   ```
   VITE_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1313"
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
