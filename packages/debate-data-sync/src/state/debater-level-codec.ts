/**
 * @fileoverview Adapts the debater XP/level store (`debate-contributor-progress`'s
 * `debaterLevel` key) — one object, not an array — to the array-of-records
 * shape `TOOL_RECORD_COLLECTIONS` syncs, as a single record with a fixed id.
 *
 * The shape check is deliberately shallow: this package can't import the
 * tool's own parser (it is a leaf), and the panel already degrades a bad value
 * to a fresh state, so all that is needed here is a safe `totalXp` for
 * {@link preferHigherDebaterXp} and a refusal to write a non-object.
 *
 * Pure — no storage or network.
