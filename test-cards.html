    <h1>Climate Change Debate Cards</h1>

    <h4>Climate change poses an existential threat to humanity and requires immediate action</h4>
    <p><strong>Smith 2023</strong> - Climate scientist at MIT, published in Nature Climate</p>
    <p>The evidence is overwhelming that human activities are causing rapid climate change. Temperature records show that the past decade has been the warmest on record, with <mark>unprecedented increases in global average temperatures</mark>. Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting at <u>accelerating rates</u>, contributing to rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities worldwide.</p>

    <h4>Renewable energy transition is economically viable and creates jobs</h4>
    <p><strong>Johnson and Lee 2024</strong> - Economic researchers, Journal of Sustainable Development</p>
    <p>Our analysis demonstrates that <mark>transitioning to renewable energy sources is not only environmentally necessary but also economically beneficial</mark>. The solar and wind energy sectors have created over 3 million jobs in the past five years. Moreover, the cost of renewable energy has dropped by 80% since 2010, making it competitive with or cheaper than fossil fuels in most markets.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>The first part is true and, as to the second part, there are implications arising from this multi-decade policy that will negatively impact China's future economic growth.</p>
