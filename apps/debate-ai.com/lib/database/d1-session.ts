/**
 * D1 read replication via the Sessions API.
 *
 * With read replication enabled, D1 answers reads from a replica in the region
 * nearest the request instead of from the single primary instance in WNAM —
 * the win is round trips, not query time. A replica can lag the primary,
 * though, so reads have to be pinned to a database version or a user can write
 * a row and then not see it. That is what a *session* is for: every query in a
 * session carries a bookmark, and D1 only lets the session read a version at
 * least as new as everything it has already seen (sequential consistency), no
 * matter which replica answers.
 *
 * The lifecycle of one request:
 *
 *   1. The Worker entry opens a session scope (`runWithD1Session`), seeded
 *      with the bookmark the client returned from its previous request.
 *   2. `sessionedD1()` wraps the raw `debate_db` binding so every statement
 *      drizzle prepares runs inside that request's single session.
 *   3. The Worker entry writes the session's closing bookmark back onto the
 *      response (`applyD1Bookmark`), so the next request picks up where this
 *      one left off.
 *
 * Requests that never touch D1 never open a session, and outside a session
 * scope (prerendering, scripts, unit tests) the wrapper is a pass-through to
 * the plain binding. The Sessions API is also a no-op on databases with read
 * replication turned off, so this is safe to deploy before — and independently
 * of — flipping the switch in the D1 dashboard.
 *
 * @see https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/read-replication/
