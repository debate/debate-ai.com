# Show, enable or disable D1 read replication for this app's database.
#
# Read replication is a property of the database itself, not of the Worker, so
# wrangler.jsonc cannot carry it — it is flipped once per database, either in
# the dashboard (D1 > debate-ai-db > Settings > Enable Read Replication) or with
# this script. Turning it on makes D1 answer reads from a replica in the
# region nearest the request instead of from the single primary instance.
#
# The Sessions API wiring in lib/database/d1-session.ts is what keeps those
# replica reads sequentially consistent. It is a no-op while replication is off and keeps
# working if replication is turned back off later, so the two changes can be
# made in either order.
#
# Usage:
#   export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
#   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...     # D1:Read for status, D1:Edit to change
#   ./scripts/d1-read-replication.sh [status|enable|disable]
#
# Note: disabling takes up to 24 hours for replicas to stop serving requests.
