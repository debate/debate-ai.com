# Ideas for New Contributors

*The list below predates this file's numbered-idea tracking convention and is generic starter material, not audited against the current codebase — treat entries here as inspiration to investigate, not confirmed gaps. See "Tracker Status" above for the actual, current state of similarly-themed work in this repo.*

### 1\. **Real-time Debate Rooms with WebSockets**

- **Description**: Implement live debate rooms where multiple users can join and debate in real-time with typing indicators, presence, and instant message delivery
- **Tech Stack**: WebSockets (Socket.io or native WS), Redis for pub/sub, React/Vue frontend
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Good First Issue**: Start with basic room creation/joining, then add real-time messaging

### 2\. **AI-Powered Argument Analysis & Feedback**

- **Description**: Build a feature that analyzes debate arguments for logical fallacies, evidence quality, and rhetorical strength, providing constructive feedback
- **use the llm in debate-speech-writer**
- **Difficulty**: High
- **Good First Issue**: Implement fallacy detection for common fallacies (ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy)

### **Argument Visualization & Mind Mapping**

- **Description**: Visual representation of debate structure - claim trees, evidence links, rebuttal chains, and argument maps
- **Tech Stack**: D3.js, Cytoscape.js, or React Flow for interactive graphs, export to image/PDF
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Good First Issue**: Build a simple claim-evidence tree component with expand/collapse
