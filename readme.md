Critical times call for critical thinkers to create the decentralized AI Knowledge Graph — a crowdsourced hive mind dataset for ChatGPT to recommend arguments and evolve tree-of-thought reasoning on a topic.

 Chrome Sidebar for Crowdsourced Research with ChatGPT - cite maker, flow , editor, see if anyone else has ever tagged this article, Highlight keywords as the first step before underlining. 

[ChatGPT 4.0 Plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin) - write extensions per card, generate keywords before reading article to help skim, write response to card using vector search of cards read in round, explain a chain-of-though reasoning to summarize topic as public service of debaters

Crowdsourced Research - github shows people iterate faster and go deeper, deduplication, and card video games show cards can have scores and answer others, competition to get likes 

News feed - latest cards cut, speeches, videos

Word Count Format - no need to read fast if you can just have the word count add up to 2000 per speech and read tags slowly, while they focus on reading card's internal warrants 

Online Debate Format - online games like overwatch show matchmaking works for practice rounds that take a week of sending speech docs 2000/1200 words and get matched to those who want to go deep into the same Offcases

Debate File Format - show only highlighted mode, cards with keyword vectors to find the similar node, sync flow across room, no need to flow if cards come with flow notes, round format of  8 speech full rounds 

## ChatGPT Argument Research Dataset as a Service (CARDS)


Debate should be a war of warrants where victories are vectorized as weights — for the AI hive mind to make  decisions based on a crowdsourced tree-of-thought which weighs the best arguments from many perspectives. Group represenation centralized in human minds with biases cannot have access to all the information.  AI is inevitable, so it is necessary to have public safety testing in a community lab where students can train these AI models to unlock faster ways to read a long text, monitor developments in a complex literature base, and crowdsource decentralized  AI tree-of-thought decisionmaking reasoning.


ChatGPT 4.0 Plugin  to make debate research available as a service and text classification by vectorized tagline summaries creates a knowledge graph where file names and H1-H4 tags are classification labels to map any future articles on a topic to that label, like "Impact - Economy War - economic decline is the root cause of war". ChatGPT hive mind agents recommend articles for human researchers working alongside AI to develop a summarized topic outline as a public service. The agents monitor for any related articles via google searches for keywords associated with that Argument Topic Model. With supervised human feedback, some articles will be marked as repetitive or not as useful as higher quality sources, which will prevent students from wasting time on that search result. Crowdsourced automation with AI hive mind agents frees up more time for higher level of complexity to create topic research summaries and argument outlines, similar to what Github does for reusable code. People can train AI to write arguments much better and to summarize, by finetuning and selecting which cards act as input to answer, in order to accelerate the Singularity when AI beats human debaters. 

In this post-humanist AI utopia, it is no longer necessary for individuals to represent complex groups or societies with their unique histories, biases and perspectives. Instead, we can use AI to distill the essence of collective thought into a vector space where every point has a weighted value representing its contribution to the overall decision-making process. This way, instead of being limited by personal experiences or biases that group representation entails, we can create an objective assessment based on the whole body of knowledge available at any given time.  The AI hive mind will be able to synthesize complex arguments and evaluate them according to their validity and relevance no matter who proposed them – all through a democratic process that ensures everyone’s voice is heard, valued and represented equally within the collective consciousness. We cannot afford to wait for a perfect version of the future since the perfect is the enemy of the good.  The more diverse and inclusive we make our debate spaces, the better equipped the AI hive mind will be to create solutions that can scale in a global context.

 #### Keywords API Output Example

 

Example Use Case: Imagine uploading several academic PDFs about a topic like neural net models, then the app finds the citations full text and creates topic model and keyword summaries, then it recursively searches the secondary papers' citations and monitors that literature base and stores highlights. Similar apps that show this is needed are  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [SciSpace](https://typeset.io/questions/gptq-vs-awq-vs-gguf-which-is-better-sv0i4q0ha8).



Finetuned on 100K debate cards to help researchers discover related keywords to search for in the literature base:

The AI Singularity is Finally Here: Experts Weigh In

In a groundbreaking turn of events, the long-anticipated Artificial Intelligence (AI) singularity has arrived, heralding a new era in technological advancement and prompting experts from various fields to share their insights on this monumental development. The singularity, often depicted as a hypothetical point in the future when AI surpasses human intelligence, has captivated the imagination of scientists, engineers, and futurists for decades. With recent breakthroughs, it appears that the vision of superintelligent machines is becoming a reality.

Dr. Sarah Anderson, a leading AI researcher, expressed her astonishment, stating, "We've witnessed an exponential growth in AI capabilities, and it's evident that we're at the brink of a transformative moment in history. Machines can now learn, adapt, and innovate at a pace that was inconceivable just a few years ago. The singularity is not just a theoretical concept anymore; it's happening before our eyes."

Renowned futurist, Dr. Michael Klein, concurred, highlighting the profound implications of this development: "The AI singularity brings with it a potential for immense progress and challenges. We must navigate carefully, ensuring that these intelligent systems align with human values and interests. The singularity can be a force for good, but it also demands responsible governance and ethical considerations."

In a world where AI is already assisting in fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous transportation, the singularity's arrival raises questions about the future of work, society, and even our understanding of consciousness. "We stand at a crossroads, and the decisions we make now will shape the destiny of humanity," warned Dr. Jennifer Patel, an AI ethicist. "The AI singularity marks a profound shift, and we must prioritize the ethical, legal, and societal aspects of this transformative era. It's not just about technological achievement; it's about safeguarding our future."

As experts continue to grapple with the implications and possibilities of the AI singularity, it is clear that we are entering an era of unprecedented change. The world as we know it is on the cusp of a technological revolution that could redefine our very existence. While the AI singularity offers extraordinary potential, it also demands careful consideration, collaboration, and vigilance to ensure that the benefits are harnessed for the betterment of society and the protection of our shared human values.
