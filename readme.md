## Debate AI

Chrome Sidebar for Crowdsourced Research - Social sharing of top research on current news, format into evidence on the page in sidebar, cite maker, flow, editor, discover news feed of latest, see if others have tagged this article before.  

Highlight keywords with AI as the first step before reading for a faster way to read, write response to card using vector search of cards read in round, explain a chain-of-though reasoning to summarize topic as public service.

 Github shows people go deeper if they can reuse well-established arguments. Card video games show cards can have scores, likes, and answer others. 

### Crowdsourced Argument Reasoning Decisionmaking & Summarization (CARDS)

Critical times call for critical thinkers to create the decentralized AI Knowledge Graph — a crowdsourced argument reasoning dataset for AI models to recommend arguments and evolve tree-of-thought reasoning. Debate should be a war of warrants where victories are vectorized as weights — for the AI collective mind to make  decisions based on a crowdsourced tree-of-thought which weighs the best arguments from many perspectives. Group represenation centralized in human minds with biases cannot have access to all the information.  AI is inevitable, so it is necessary to have public safety testing to train AI models to unlock faster ways to read a long text, monitor developments in a complex literature base, and crowdsource decentralized  AI tree-of-thought decisionmaking reasoning.

We can use AI to distill the essence of collective thought into a vector space where every point has a weighted value representing its contribution to the overall decision-making process. AI collective consciousness  will be able to synthesize complex arguments and evaluate them according to their validity and relevance no matter who proposed them. AI agents will learn what arguments and sources are more persuasive in different contexts and to different profiles of readers. Crowdsourced automation with AI agents create topic argument outlines, similar to what Github does for reusable code, which AI can learn to weigh complex decision key to solve for AI decision-making alignment.  Vectorized tagline summaries are based ond Heading tags are classification labels to map any future articles on a topic to that label.  AI Research Agents recommend articles for human researchers working alongside AI to develop a summarized topic outline as a public service. The agents monitor for any related articles via google searches for keywords associated with that Argument Topic Model. Imagine uploading several academic PDFs, then the app finds the citations full text and creates topic model and keyword summaries, then  monitors that literature base and stores highlights. People will make personal knowledge bases of what influenced them online in news and research to create AI assistants with deep knowledge of a user's perspective. Similar apps that show this is needed are [Anthropic Persuation](https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-model-persuasiveness), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [SciSpace](https://typeset.io/questions/gptq-vs-awq-vs-gguf-which-is-better-sv0i4q0ha8) and [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai).

#### Online Format

Online Format - online games show matchmaking works for longer practices like sending speech docs 2000/1200 words and get matched by topic. Word Count Format - no need to read fast if you can just have the word count add up to 2000 per speech and read tags slowly. Toggle Highlighted-Only Visibility Mode and Show speeches side-by-side. Flow-in-Speech entries while watching stream, and link a flow entry to a response bubble. Sync flow across room, no need to flow if cards come with flow notes, upload and browse round formats of 8 full speech docs.
