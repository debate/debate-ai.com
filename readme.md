Critical times call for critical thinkers to create the decentralized AI Knowledge Graph â€” a crowdsourced hive mind dataset for ChatGPT to recommend arguments and evolve tree-of-though reasoning on a topic as a public service.

_Being_ is Becoming: Whatever things can be, that is what they must become.



## Ideas  

 Chrome Extension - cite maker, flow with timer, editor, Colab Research Sidebar

Colab Research Sidebar - see if anyone else has ever tagged this article  and put in shared hive mind. Highlight keywords as the first step before underlining. 

[ChatGPT 4.0 Plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin) - write extensions per card, generate keywords before reading article to help skim, write response to card using vector search of cards read in round, explain a chain-of-though reasoning to summarize topic as public service of debaters

Crowdsourced Research - github shows people iterate faster and go deeper, deduplication, and card video games show cards can have scores and answer others

Public service of best researched ranked on a public issue,  competition to get likes for discovering a quote you are eager to share

News feed - latest cards cut, latest debates, videos

Word Count Format - no need to read fast if you can just have the word count add up to 2000 per speech and read tags slowly, while they focus on reading card's internal warrants 

Online format - online games like overwatch show matchmaking works for practice rounds that take a week of sending speech docs 2000/1200 words and get matched to those who want to go deep into the same Offcases

Debate file format - show only highlighted, cards with keyword vectors, 

Flow - sync timer across room, no need to flow if cards come with flow notes,

Round format - 8 speech full rounds instead of speechdocs, record last 3 rebuttals
