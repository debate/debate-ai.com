## Debate AI 

Debate AI enables competitive debaters in PF, LD & Policy to streamline AI-powered debate research management, flow tracking, and evidence debate analysis.


- **Debate Management**: Create and organize debate topics, arguments, and rebuttals
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user support with live updates
- **Rich Text Editing**: Format your arguments with full markdown support
- **Timer Management**: Built-in debate timers for structured discussions

## Crowdsourced Annotated Research Dataset as a Service (CARDS)

Critical times call for critical thinkers to create the decentralized AI Knowledge Graph — a crowdsourced argument reasoning dataset for AI models to recommend arguments and evolve tree-of-thought reasoning. Debate should be a war of warrants where victories are vectorized as weights — for the AI collective mind to make  decisions based on a crowdsourced tree-of-thought which weighs the best arguments from many perspectives. Group represenation centralized in human minds with biases cannot have access to all the information.  AI is inevitable, so it is necessary to have public safety testing to train AI models to unlock faster ways to read a long text, monitor developments in a complex literature base, and crowdsource decentralized  AI tree-of-thought decisionmaking reasoning.

 Key metadata is extracted for LLM analysis, enabling LLMs to review the full text, identify logic flaws or unsupported claims, and flag overstatements. LLMs also extend warrants, summarize support, and suggest where each card fits within the Topic Research Unified Tree Hierarchy (TRUTH). The system is built for intersubjective, consensus-driven research claim to find ground truth on issues and evaluate any claim's proximity to accepted truths and human values. This can reduce LLM hallucination and steer alignment with common social values as AI gains capacity to replace human leaders of organizations.

Chrome Sidebar for Crowdsourced Research - Social sharing of top research on current news, format into evidence on the page in sidebar, cite maker, flow, editor, discover news feed of latest, see if others have tagged this article before, highlight keywords with AI as the first step before reading, write response to card using vector search of cards read in round.
